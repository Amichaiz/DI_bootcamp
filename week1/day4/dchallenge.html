                <h2>Really informative info</h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in
                    several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new
                    agricultural way
                    of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went
                    on,
                    trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are
                    grown
                    all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less
                    suitable
                    locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables, and global trade in agricultural products
                    allows consumers
                    to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence
                    farmers supplying
                    the needs of their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops.
                    Depending on the
                    type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing, and
                    marketing.
