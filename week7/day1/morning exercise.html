For today’s algorithm, we are going to write a function 
that will take in three inputs:
two arrays keyboards and drives and an integer budget.

let budget = 10;
let keyboards = [3, 1];
let drives = [5, 2, 8];

// the first keyboard
3 + 5 = 8
3 + 2 = 5
3 + 8 = 11
// second keyboard
1 + 5 = 6
1 + 2 = 3
1 + 8 = 9‏*/

function expense(arr1,arr2,budge) {
    let max = 0
    arr1.forEach(element => {
        arr2.forEach(e => {
            if(element+e>max && element+e<=budge)
            max=element+e
        });
    });
    return max
}
let budget = 10;
let keyboards = [3, 1];
let drives = [5, 2, 8];
console.log(expense(keyboards,drives,budget));
